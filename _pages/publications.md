0. **Ceremony expenditures in a developing country**
<!--- > <font size="2"> Festival and ceremony expenditures occupy large proportions in household consumption in developing countries.  However, it has been understudied how households afford such expenditures and how the expenditures affect their lives.  In this paper, using a coming-of-age ceremony in Latin culture called quinceañeras, I will overcome the endogeneity associated with the timings of festivals and ceremonies and address these questions.  With Mexican repeated cross-section data, I show that households afford quinceañeras through saving and transfers from other households and quinceañeras crowd-out less urgent consumption and agricultural business inputs. </font> --->

0. **Temperature and the work of bureaucrats**  
with [Ana Paula Melo](https://sites.google.com/view/anamelo/) (*submitted*)
<!--- > <font size="2"> A growing body of literature shows evidence that high temperatures negatively impact performance.  Less studied is the impact on work performance of government bureaucrats.  Our paper estimates the impact of temperature on auditors' work performance, measured by the likelihood with which auditors report corruption.  We use data on hundreds of municipalities randomly audited in an anti-corruption program in Brazil.  We find that auditors are more likely to report corruption if their fieldwork is conducted under higher temperatures.  We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying our findings, which highlight important venues for further research.  Our results have implications for understanding the influence of external factors on important government functions that impact social welfare. </font> --->
