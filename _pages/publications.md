0. **Expensive ceremonies and the lives of households in developing countries: Evidence from quinceañeras in Mexico** (*Job Market Paper*)
<!--- > <font size="2"> Festival and ceremony expenditures occupy large proportions in household consumption in developing countries.  However, it has been understudied how households afford such expenditures and how the expenditures affect their lives.  In this paper, using a coming-of-age ceremony in Latin culture called quinceañeras, I will overcome the endogeneity associated with the timings of festivals and ceremonies and address these questions.  With Mexican repeated cross-section data, I show that households afford quinceañeras through saving and transfers from other households and quinceañeras crowd-out less urgent consumption and agricultural business inputs. </font> --->

0. **[Temperature and the work of bureaucrats](http://anapmelo.github.io/files/manuscript_MM.pdf)**  
with [Ana Paula Melo](https://www.apmelo.com/) (*under review*)
> A growing body of literature shows evidence that high temperatures negatively impact performance. Less studied is the impact on the work performance of government bureaucrats. Our paper estimates the impact of temperature on auditors’ work performance, measured by the likelihood with which auditors report corruption. We use data on hundreds of municipalities randomly audited in an anti-corruption program in Brazil. We find that auditors are more likely to report corruption if their fieldwork is conducted under higher temperatures. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying our findings, which highlight important avenues for further research. Our results have implications for understanding the influence of external factors on essential government functions that impact social welfare.

0. **Temperature, effort, and achievement: Evidence from a large-scale standardized exam in Brazil**  
with [Ana Paula Melo](https://www.apmelo.com/)
> We provide empirical evidence on how the exam stakes affect the sensitivity of performance to temperature. We explore the unique Brazilian context in which the stakes of a large-scale standardized exam change from relatively low to high. Using within-individual variations in exam scores and temperature across two exam days, we find a negative impact of high temperature on exam scores. The effects are non-linear, especially when the temperature increases to the high 30s. When we interact temperature with the proportion of universities in a locality using the national exam as the primary admission criteria, we find that the higher the stakes, the smaller the effects of temperature on exam performance.
