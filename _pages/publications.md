0.  **Suzuki, Mizuhiro**. (2021). *Ceremony expenditures in a developing country*

> Festival and ceremony expenditures occupy large proportions in household consumption in developing countries.
> However, it has been understudied how households afford such expenditures and how the expenditures affect their lives.
> In this paper, using a coming-of-age ceremony in Latin culture called quincea{\~n}eras, I will overcome the endogeneity associated with the timings of festivals and ceremonies and address these questions.
> With Mexican repeated cross-section data, I show that households afford quincea{\~n}eras through saving and transfers from other households and quincea{\~n}eras crowd-out less urgent consumption and agricultural business inputs.
