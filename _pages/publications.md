0. **Ceremony expenditures in a developing country**
<!--- > <font size="2"> Festival and ceremony expenditures occupy large proportions in household consumption in developing countries.  However, it has been understudied how households afford such expenditures and how the expenditures affect their lives.  In this paper, using a coming-of-age ceremony in Latin culture called quinceañeras, I will overcome the endogeneity associated with the timings of festivals and ceremonies and address these questions.  With Mexican repeated cross-section data, I show that households afford quinceañeras through saving and transfers from other households and quinceañeras crowd-out less urgent consumption and agricultural business inputs. </font> --->

0. **[Temperature and the work of bureaucrats](http://anapmelo.github.io/files/manuscript_MM.pdf)**  
with [Ana Paula Melo](https://www.apmelo.com/) (*submitted*)
> We evaluate the relationship between temperature shocks and the performance of bureacracy. We study a program in Brazil that randomly allocated audit teams to municipalities all over the country and we find a positive effect of temperature on reported levels of corruption.

0. **Temperature, effort, and achievement: Evidence from a large-scale standardized exam in Brazil**  
with [Ana Paula Melo](https://www.apmelo.com/)
> We provide empirical evidence on how the exam stakes affect the sensitivity of performance to temperature. We explore the unique Brazilian context in which the stakes of a large-scale standardized exam change from relatively low to high. Using within-individual variations in exam scores and temperature across two exam days, we find a negative impact of high temperature on exam scores. The effects are non-linear, especially when the temperature increases to the high 30s. When we interact temperature with the proportion of universities in a locality using the national exam as the primary admission criteria, we find that the higher the stakes, the smaller the effects of temperature on exam performance.
