<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

<!--- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. --->

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Agricultural & Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://aae.wisc.edu/).
My interest lies in development economics, environmental economics, and applied econometrics.
I will be on the job market in the Fall of 2021, will attend the 2022 ASSA conference in Boston and plan to graduate in May 2022.
