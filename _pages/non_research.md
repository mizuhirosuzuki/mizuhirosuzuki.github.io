## Economics ##

- **[R replication of Banerjee et al. (2013)](https://github.com/sakinashibuya/MFdiffusion_replication/blob/master/Code/R/Replication/noEndorsement.pdf)**: I replicated the structural estimation of a network model in [Banerjee et al. (2013), "The Diffusion of Microfinance"](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1236498)  
(with [Kazuki Motohashi](https://kazukimotohashi.github.io/) and [Sakina Shibuya](https://aae.wisc.edu/grad-students/sshibuya2/))

- **[Julia replication of Munshi and Rosenzweig (2016)](https://github.com/mizuhirosuzuki/EconPapers/blob/master/Munshi_Rosenzweig_2016_julia.ipynb)**: I reproduced the baseline result of the structural estimation in [Munshi and Rosenzweig (2016), "Networks and Misallocation: Insurance, Migration, and the Rural-Urban Wage Gap"](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20131365)

- **[Julia numerical exercise on the dynamic model in Duflo et al. (2012)](https://github.com/mizuhirosuzuki/EconPapers/blob/master/Duflo2012.ipynb)**: I computationally solved the dynamic model in [Duflo, Hanna, and Ryan (2012), "Incentives Work: Getting Teachers to Come to School"](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.102.4.1241), which can be directly used for the structural estimation of the model, which can be directly used for the structural estimation of the model

- **[Julia linear programming formulation for two-sided matching](https://notes.quantecon.org/submission/64b8ad3fc1622a001a21e0ea)**: I solved the stable matching problem with the linear programming formulation

- **[Julia implementation of the stochastic optimal growth model with the collocation method + Gaussian quadrature approximation](https://notes.quantecon.org/submission/64598c57836c9a001a82ed2f)**: I implemented the collocation method for functional approximation and Gaussian quadrature method for the approximation of expectation

- **[Python numerical exercise on the dynamic model in Fafchanps (1993)](https://github.com/mizuhirosuzuki/EconPapers/blob/master/Fafchamps_1993.ipynb)**: I computationally solved the dynamic model in [Fafchamps (1993), "Sequential Labor Decisions Under Uncertainty: An Estimable Household Model of West-African Farmers"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951497?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

- **[Memos on Berry (1992)](https://github.com/mizuhirosuzuki/EconPapers/blob/master/Berry1992.ipynb)**: For deeper understandings on [Berry (1992), "Estimation of a Model of Entry in the Airline Industry"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951571?seq=1), I answered the following two questions in the document: (1) How complicated will it be to compute the distribution of equilibrium numbers of entrants? (2) How can we obtain the identities of entrants under the assumed decision order?

- **[Derivations of equations in Foster and Rosenzweig (1995)](https://github.com/mizuhirosuzuki/EconPapers/blob/master/Foster_Rosenzweig_1995.ipynb)**: I show how to derive equations in [Foster and Rosenzweig (1995), "Learning by Doing and Learning from Others: Human Capital and Technical Change in Agriculture"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138708)

- **[Review of MATLAB codes in Kaboski and Townsend (2011)](https://github.com/mizuhirosuzuki/EconPapers/blob/master/Kaboski_Townsend_2011.ipynb)**: I reviewed the MATLAB codes and summarized the structural estimation procedure in [Kaboski and Townsend (2011), "A Structural Evaluation of a Large-Scale Quasi-Experimental Microfinance Initiative"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA7079)

## Non-economics ##

- **[R Econ Visual Library](https://worldbank.github.io/r-econ-visual-library/)**: I was the main contributor of creating the website which showcases R visualization focusing on impact evaluation. I worked on this while I was working for [DIME Analytics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics) as a short-term consultant.

- **[Stata linter](https://github.com/worldbank/stata-linter)**: I was one of the main contributors of creating the linting tool for Stata. I worked on this while I was working for [DIME Analytics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics) as a short-term consultant.

- **[GitHub repo for a ML competition, "Open AI Caribbean Challenge: Mapping Disaster Risk from Aerial Imagery"](https://github.com/mizuhirosuzuki/RoofMaterial)**: This repository stores files used for a competition [Open AI Caribbean Challenge: Mapping Disaster Risk from Aerial Imagery](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/58/disaster-response-roof-type/), which resulted in 20th / 1425 competitors. In this competition, we are given images of each city in Colombia, Guatemala, and St. Lucia, coordinates of buildings, and for training buildings, their roof materials (cement, healthy metal, incomplete, irregular metal, or other). Using the information, we predict the roof materials of test buildings.

- **[Curated list of resources](https://github.com/mizuhirosuzuki/resources)**: I created a curated list of resources for... anything, basically, from data, programming, economics, to [good sushi restaurants in Tokyo](https://twitter.com/tetteresearch/status/924344536565985281/photo/1).
